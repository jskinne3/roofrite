# Build

This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/), which depends upon Node.js version 18 or higher.Eleventy itself can then be installed with the command:
```
npm install @11ty/eleventy
```

To build the website locally and run the server, run the command:
```
npm start
```
Then visit <http://localhost:8080/>

# Update

To update the website's content, you'll edit Markdown files, which end with the `.md` file extension. For example, the file `index.md` holds the main contents of the homepage.

# Deploy

Using Git, commit your changes to the `main` branch; then visit <https://roofrite.pages.dev/>

      <h3>Structural Versatility</h3>
      <p>
        Most roofing materials are limited by the slope of the roof. Metal roofs can be installed at almost any slope from vertical to near horizontal.

      <h3>When Maintenance is Required</h3>
      <p>
        If your metal roof shows signs of loose fasteners, rust, or seam separation, early repair can prevent widespread leaks or damage.

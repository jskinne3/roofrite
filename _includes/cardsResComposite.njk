      <h3>Designed for Durability</h3>
      <p>
        Composite roofs resist fire, impact, and severe weather better than many natural materials. They have comparable lifespans to Metal, but do not dent.

      <h3>When Natural Materials Wear Out</h3>
      <p>
        If your slate or cedar roof is cracking, leaking, or degrading, composite can offer a longer-lasting, more cost effective, and low-maintenance upgrade.

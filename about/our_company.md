## About Us

Roof Rite started as a small residential roofing company in Lincoln, NE. We saw the need for a consistent, dependable roofing company in an ever-inconsistent industry.

With each project we standardized our roofing process. As time went on though, both the size and scope of those projects would change, dramatically. We found that our customers required more than roofing, and would seek us out from farther than Nebraska’s borders.

While we found our start in roofing, **we’ve grown to offer a near-comprehensive catalog of exterior services.** Each new trade gave us the opportunity to accommodate the needs of more businesses, and it’s earned us a reputation.

We’ve steadily grown from a midwestern roofing company, to a nationally recognized exterior contractor, excited to take our grain-belt craftsmanship and customer service to further reaches of the country.

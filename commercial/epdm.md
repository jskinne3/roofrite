## EPDM: Durable, Weather-Resistant, Traditional

EPDM, also known as rubber roofing, is a reliable material that is commonly used in commercial buildings. Its strength lies in its resistance to extreme temperatures. EPDM roofing is easy to install and maintain, making it a popular choice for flat and low-sloped roofs. It also has a long lifespan, lasting up to 20 years with proper care.

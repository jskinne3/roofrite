hero_alt: "Elegant side view of the historic Muir House, a red-brick Italianate structure with white trim and ornate brackets installed under the soffits of a newly installed roof. The building features arched windows, a white wooden back porch, and a brick driveway lightly dusted with snow. The preserved structure sits surrounded by leafless winter trees, in front of a dim, sunsetting sky."

## Food & Health Facilities

Restaurants, hospitals, clinics, and cold storage facilities: these sensitive environments all have exteriors that degrade overtime. When your facility needs work done, donâ€™t compromise. We work with you to ensure your operation stays safe, clean, and compliant.

Roof Rite specializes in building exteriors that support these critical environments with precision and care. We use materials that stand up to temperature swings and harsh contaminants so you can stay focused on the work that matters most.

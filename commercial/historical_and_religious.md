## Historical Buildings & Religious Structures

Historical buildings and places of worship pose a unique challenge for exterior contractors. Most feature extreme slopes, towering architecture, and require an abundance of specialized trades. Often these exteriors protect fine interiors and items that require special consideration.

Given these stakes, we’re honored to have been awarded several contracts for large religious and historical projects. It’s given us perspective on the needs of these special cases that allow us to update your exterior with minimal disturbance to your regular services.

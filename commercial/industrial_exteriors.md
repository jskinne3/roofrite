hero_alt: "Elegant side view of the historic Muir House, a red-brick Italianate structure with white trim and ornate brackets installed under the soffits of a newly installed roof. The building features arched windows, a white wooden back porch, and a brick driveway lightly dusted with snow. The preserved structure sits surrounded by leafless winter trees, in front of a dim, sunsetting sky."

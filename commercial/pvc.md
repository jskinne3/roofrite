## PVC: Long-Lasting and Low-Maintenence

PVC is a thermoplastic roofing material that is commonly used for commercial and industrial buildings. Itâ€™s the go-to roofing solution for most restaurants due to its strength, durability, and resistance to chemicals, oils, and grease. Similar to TPO, PVC roofs are energy-efficient and have a reflective surface that can help to reduce energy costs. PVC roofing is a popular choice for buildings that require a high level of chemical resistance or are located in areas with high pollution.

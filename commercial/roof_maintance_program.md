## What is an RMP?

Every business needs a good roof. With so much surface area, itâ€™s easy for small leaks to hide, and those small leaks can have disastrous consequences. In situations like these, an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure.

### A Roofing Maintenance Program is your best bet to protect your investment.

With an RMP, Roof Rite will conduct periodic inspections and continued maintenance. We pay special attention to the common failure points of roofing systems. This is how we can personally guarantee a leak-free exterior for years to come. You have our team of our dedicated professionals at your disposal.

## TPO: Energy-Efficient and Environmentally Friendly

TPO roofing is a popular flat roofing method used for both commercial and residential buildings. It is known for its durability, cost-effectiveness, and energy efficiency. TPO roofs have a white reflective surface that reflects sunlight and reduces the amount of heat that is absorbed into the building. This can result in lower energy costs and a more comfortable interior environment. TPO roofing also resists weathering and UV rays, making it an ideal option for areas with high sun exposure.

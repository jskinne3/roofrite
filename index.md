## About us

We are certified contractors for many of North America’s largest and most trusted roofing manufacturers, including [GAF](https://www.gaf.com/en-us/roofing-contractors/residential/usa/ne/lincoln/roof-rite-exteriors-1113822), [Malarkey](https://www.malarkeyroofing.com/company-profile?company=Roof%2BRite%2BExteriors), [Lomanco](https://www.lomanco.com/), and [Gaco](https://gaco.com/). We are also members of the Apartment Association of Nebraska, and both the [Midwestern](https://mrca.org/aws/MRCA/pt/sp/home_page) and [National Roofing Contractors Associations](https://www.nrca.net/). These organizations help to keep us current, connected, and knowledgeable so that we can bring you the best exterior solutions available.

At Roof Rite, we pride ourselves on providing comprehensive roofing systems. Not all roofing materials are made equally, and not all roofing products work equally well together. We don’t window shop; we use exclusive manufacturers for roofing materials that are designed to work well with one another.

This keeps issues to a minimum, and makes repairs and maintenance easier to assess. It also allows us to offer the best warranties in the industry for a variety of roofing options.

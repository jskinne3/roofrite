## About us

Roof Rite is a premier national exteriors contractor based in Lincoln, Nebraska. We offer a **comprehensive suite of exterior services**, including but not limited to: low and steep slope roofing, structural wood framing and masonry, residential and commercial gutter systems, exterior siding, painting and staining, doors and windows, & tuckpointing and aesthetic masonry repairs.

Our team of skilled professionals is committed to ensuring that each project is completed on time, within budget, and to the highest standards of quality.

Roof Rite started as a small residential roofing company in Lincoln, NE with a simple goal in mind: to provide quality roofing services to homeowners and businesses in the local community. We saw the need for a consistent, dependable roofing company in an ever-inconsistent industry.

With each project we standardized our roofing process. As time went on though, both the size and scope of those projects would change, dramatically. We found that our customers required more than roofing,and would seek us out from farther than Nebraska's borders.

While we found our start in roofing, **we've grown to offer a wide range of exterior services**. Each new trade gave us the opportunity to accommodate the needs of more businesses, and it's earned us a reputation.

We've steadily grown from a midwestern roofing company, to a nationally recognized exteriors contractor, and we're excited to take our grain-belt craftsmanship and customer service to further reaches of the country.

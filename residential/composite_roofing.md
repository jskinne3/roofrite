## Composite Roofing

Composite roofs mimic the appearance of wood and stone without requiring the upkeep and maintenance of an organic roof.

Our composite roofs outperform natural slate and cedar shake against fire, hail, and wind. Whatâ€™s more, as these materials are manufactured, their look can be finely tailored to the style of your home.

They provide exceptional protection, versatile appearance, and lasting performance.

The newly installed, patina-free copper pent roof contrasts with the dark metal window trim and stone exterior, adding an elegant architectural detail beneath a dormer window, and presidential shingle roof.

## All Your Exterior Needs

While our name is Roof Rite, we’re proud to do exterior work of all kinds. Nature doesn’t discriminate, so neither do we.

We do soffit and fascia, flashings, chimney chases, snow guards, and skylights. We also do paint and stain, window and door wraps, and
many other trades. Just ask! We're happy to lend our services so you can be sure it's done rite!

## Metal Roofing

These life-long roofs offer superb protection against wind, hail, and fire. Their rust-proof coatings make them immune to cracking and corrosion, and their durable nature precludes them from the costly repair and maintenance of most roofs.

As a result, this adaptable material has been an increasingly popular option for both commercial and residential roofs.

The newly installed roof, completed by Roof Rite, features dark asphalt shingles that complement the house’s vintage charm. Bare trees frame the house, suggesting late fall or early winter, with dried leaves scattered across the lawn and walkway."

## Siding

The siding of your home or business is the first thing that catches the eye from street view. Whether your siding is damaged or in need of an update, it can give off a bad first impression, and we at Roof Rite can help.

Whatever your siding needs, whether it’s vinyl, steel, aluminum, fiber cement, stucco/EIFS, we
have hundreds of colors and styles available from Mastic, James Hardie, Rollex, and many others to fit your desired style and budget.
